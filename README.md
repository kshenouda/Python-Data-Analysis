# Python-Data-Analysis

This repository contains projects I've completed from a Udemy course. I'm currently taking a Python course for data analysis, and I'm applying my knowledge in Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn into several projects. The datasets come from Kaggle. 

My first project contains analysis and visualizations on 911 calls made throughout the US during 2016. I found some interesting insights from the data. First, the most common reason for a 911 call in 2016 was EMS (emergency services) with about 50000 calls, the second being traffic with about 35000 calls, and the third/last being fire with about 15000 calls. Second, 911 calls peak around January and mid-July. The most common tiem for a 911 call was between 4-6pm on the weekdays, and weekends do not have as many calls. I've also made several visualizations for the data, including line graphs, bar graphs, and heatmaps.
